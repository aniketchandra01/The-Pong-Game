# The-Pong-Game
The Pong Game project is a classic arcade-style game created in Python using the turtle graphics library. Players control paddles to hit a ball back and forth, aiming to score points by getting the ball past their opponent's paddle. The game features two paddles, a continuously moving ball, and keyboard controlsâ€”typically "W" and "S" for the left paddle, and the "Up" and "Down" arrow keys for the right paddle.
